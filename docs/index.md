# Getting Started

Deliverybot is a GitHub app, to get started with deployments we need a
repository and to install the Deliverybot app onto that repo. The below guide
will walk you through getting an example repository setup.

### 1. [Fork the example repository][example]

Visit the [example repository][example] and create a new fork.

### 2. [Install the Deliverybot GitHub app][app]

Sign up at <{{site.github_app_url}}> and connect the application to your GitHub
repository.

### 3. Push a commit to watch the workflows kick off!

Check out the GitHub actions tab as well as the Deliverybot page.
