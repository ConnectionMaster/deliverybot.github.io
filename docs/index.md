# Getting Started

Deliverybot is a GitHub app. You can [deploy it yourself](self-hosting) or you
can use the [public paid tier]({{site.deliverybot_url}}) to deploy your code.

The best way to get started is by visiting the [example repository][example] and
forking the repository. This example is all wired up with GitHub actions to
deliver your deployments. After forking the repo you will need to:

1. Sign up at <{{site.github_app_url}}> and connect the application to your
   GitHub repository.

2. Push a commit to watch the workflows kick off!

Once you have a working example you can read more [recipes][recipes] to get you
started. Read about [how it works][how] for a more in depth perspective on how
Deliverybot deploys your code.
