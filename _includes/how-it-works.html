      <p>1. Click a button or run a Slack command to kick off a deployment.</p>
      <p>2. GitHub receives a deployment event and triggers an Action or a webhook.</p>
      <p>3. Your code receives the event payload via actions or webhooks and kicks off a deploy.</p>
      <p>4. Once the deployment is complete a status event is fired.</p>
