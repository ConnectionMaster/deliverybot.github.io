# About

Deliverybot was born out of the lack of tooling around deploying to Kubernetes
from GitHub. We have some fantastic API's and capabilities built in to GitHub
with the deployments api but the open source tooling around this is lacking.
Deliverybot is aiming to fill that gap.

The project is open core with most of the functionality living in the core repo
as a GitHub app.

### Project goals

- Don't try and deliver deployments, automate when they happen.
- Adopt and codify the best practices for deployments with Kubernetes, GitHub
  and more tools.
- Be the simplest and safest solution to deploy to Kubernetes from GitHub.
- Provide recipes and to manage complex workflows, don't prescribe or build in
  specific workflows.
